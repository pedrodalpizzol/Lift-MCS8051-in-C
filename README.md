# Lift-MCS8051-in-C
A simple 3 floor lift backbone code for a microprocessor, actually working, made in a school-project in UFRGS.

Open the zip, the last version of the project is projeto_keil_2.0, this one should work.
Also we have fluxograms of our original thoughts, it has been made some changes throught the course of the project.
